            "The Congregation of St. Basil is a Catholic male religious community of French origin, settled with greater force in Canada and United States. In Latin America it is present in Mexico and since 1987 in Colombia.",
            "In our country it was first installed in the parish of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción in Cali city, by 1995 it established  its second national headquarter in the city of Medellin and at the beginning of the third millennium was founded a house destined for training in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá.",
            "Among the group of Basilian religious who participated in the first settlement of the community in Colombia were Father Francisco and Father Roberto and Rafael Lópera, at that time a candidate. In the last twenty-five years, Father Rafael, Father Pedro, Father Juan Carlos and Father Oscar have been ordained as priests of the Congregation of St. Basil. In addition, many men of faith have shared several years of their life with the Congregation, although they have subsequently retired, their work helped to build the Community, while this deeply permeated their Christians beings.",
            "Today Colombia is favored with the presence of seven Basilian priests, two in the city of Cali, two in Medellín and three in the city of Bogotá, including Father Felipe Platt in the latter, along with them a significant group of candidates, postulants and scholastics advance their formation process, projecting at least two priestly ordinations in the next three years. The project of constituting a Female Community of San Basilio, with two religious and a candidate for this 2012, is added to the work of the brothers.",
            "As for the overtaken labor, we can refer that the parishes of Cali and Medellín are articulating the work of evangelization with support for development; The dynamics of Cali promotes the Basilian charism from formal education at the Institute Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, while the Basilian being is cultivated in the Antioquia capital through popular education. The two parishes boost productive projects, although with more force in Medellín. Bogotá emphasizes the formation of people interested in entering the Congregation and pastoral collaboration is provided tangentially in the parish of Egipto and others.",
            "In relation to the presence of the religious woman in the Congregation of San Basilio, during the last years, the Basilian Sisters have been officially constituted. This is the unique experience in the field of the Congregation at international level. Although they were born in the Basilian Parish in Medellín, they are currently located in the Parish of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción in the city of Cali, performing their work both in the educational pastoral of the INSA, as in the pastoral in the neighborhoods, especially in the formation and organization of women."

        "history": [
            "They were founded in France, the Annonay region, by ten diocesan priests who decided to radically live Community Life, following Jesus. Moved by the need of the time, they dedicated their efforts to teaching young people and preaching the Gospel.",
            "Firm in their purpose, united by Common Life, they professed the vows of Chastity, Poverty and Obedience in 1822.",
            "In the last 192 years they have been established in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Saint Lucia and Colombia.",
            "In Colombia they have been present since 1987 in the city of Cali, Parroquia Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, in the Andrés Sanín neighborhood. Consistent with their choice, faithful to their charism for Education and Preaching, they lead the parish and the institute Nuestra Señora of the Assumption. ",
            "With the firm purpose of responding thoroughly to the reality of Colombia, the Congregation of San Basilio made its second foundation in Colombia in 1995. The second house was established in the city of Medellín, initially in the Parish in Prado Center, later in the Divino Ecce Homo Parish in the Blanquizal neighborhood, currently and definitively in the San Basilio Parish, Olaya Herrera neighborhood, where a temple was built and a pastoral process led by Father Roberto Seguín was consolidated ",
            "Aware of the importance of the education of future Basilians, in 1997 a house was established in the city of Bogotá. Although it was explored in the El Campín and July 20 neighborhoods with the Novitiate and the Scholasticate, in the year from 1999, we chose our own space called Basiliana Annonay House of Formation, in the Egypt neighborhood. ",
            "Currently, in 2014, the Congregation of Basilian Priests is organizing the House for the Novitiate in the city of Santa Martha, as a budding experience, it will surely require immense efforts, but, redundant in the future of fruits for the work of the Kingdom here on Earth, among our People.
